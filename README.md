# Slay-The-Spire-in-Python
A text based version of Slay the Spire coded in python
I have no idea how to release the game so just fork the repo and run it in a code editor

DISCLAIMER: I am not a professional, if you wonder why the code sucks, that's why.


## VSCode Dev Environment

If using VSCode, there is a devcontainer that can be used to get up and running quickly.  This will install all the dependencies and allow you to run the game.

Quick Start:
  - Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
  - Install [Devcontainer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) VSCode Extension
  - Open the project in VSCode
  - Click the green button in the bottom left corner of VSCode
  - Select `Dev Container: Reopen in Container`
  - Wait for the container to build
  - Open a terminal in VSCode
  - Run `./scripts/play.sh` to start the game or `./scripts/test.sh` to run the tests
